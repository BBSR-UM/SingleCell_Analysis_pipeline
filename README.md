Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

Name
Single-Cell data Analyses pipeline

Description
Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for defining cellular diversity in tumors. For the pipline the data singlecell data from the CRC study. The data was downloded from the the NCBI GEO (GSE146771).

Visuals
Example Plots

Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
